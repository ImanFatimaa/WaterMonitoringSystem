# WaterMonitoringSystem
# ARDUINO BASED WATER MONITORING SYSTEM
# INTRODUCTION:  
Arduino based water monitoring system deals with implementing logics of monitoring water level of any home-based tank as well as deals with monitoring of waters turbidity and water’s temperature. By using this Arduino based project we can ensure that there will be no outflow of water from tank as we are continuously monitoring water level. At same time, we are ensuring the water’s quality by continuously checking its turbidity and temperature to make sure that its safe for use at homes. We have used different sensors for successful implementation of this project and their details are mentioned below in sensor explanations.
# OBJECTIVE: 
The main purpose of this project is to monitor water systems at homes and to solve the real time base problems of water overflow from tanks and ensuring the quality of water to make it drinkable and adequate for home use and monitoring temperature of water to make water’s use safe.
